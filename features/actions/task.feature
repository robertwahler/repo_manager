Feature: Invoke external tasks, normally Thor tasks.

  Tasks can be defined by the app and placed in lib/tasks or tasks can be
  defined by the user and placed in the user tasks folder.

  Examples

      basic_app task test:init /to/some/folder

  Task action is not required

      basic_app test:init /to/some/folder

  Add user tasks by specifying folders.tasks in the master config file
  and add Thor tasks.  See background scenario.

  Background: A master configuration file
    Given a file named "basic_app.conf" with:
      """
